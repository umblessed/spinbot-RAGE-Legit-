This is my first work. What does it all consist of?

Legit - a regular spinbot, your character will spin and look down if you have a weapon in your hand + a slightly long jump.

Rage - specially made for XVH. Many aims will not be able to function on you, because you start flying like crazy.

Throw it into the moonloader folder.

All requirements - "sampfuncs, vkeys, memory, math, samp.events".

Activation - /cheat
